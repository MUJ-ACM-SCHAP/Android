Firstly, Thank you for reading this! This means you are here, ready to contribute to this repository. We at MUJ ACM SCHAP truly want each one of you to become good developers and coders. Contributing on github is an important step for that!

## General instructions
- You *must* be a member of MUJ ACM Student Chapter to make major contributions to this repository (preferably a student in the android course).
- Please make sure your real name is shown on your github profile. This helps in verifying that you are indeed a member of MUJ ACM SCHAP. In case you are not in the android dev class, it is also suggested to mention in a comment which course you are in and why you are making a PR.
- In case you spot a minor issue (like a small bug, a typo or some other minor issue - please feel free to correct it in a PR and 
- In case you spot an issue which you cant fix, open an issue.
- When adding your own app, make sure you dont change other people's app in a major way (like by renaming a directory which affects other apps as well)
- When adding a new project/assignment, follow assignment guidelines below

## Assignments
When adding your assignments, follow these general rules:
- Make sure you have created the android app in the folder `/Assignment #/your_name` to help collecting all similar assignments together. It is always suggested to create new assignments as new android studio projects rather than modifying previous one's and changing the folder names.
- For major projects, you will be told to use a specific folder (say `/Diwali Project/Your name/`. Please stick to that.

## Examples
Usually, only mentors will add example apps in the `Examples` folder. You can, however, add your own app there if you believe it is a really good example app. In that case use the folder format `Examples/project_name`.

If you spot a mistake in an example, do submit a PR to fix it!

## Creating a pull request/issue
***This section is only for those who don't know how to create a PR or an issue***

So, what brought you here today?
* Found an issue or bug in this repo? 
  * First, look under the [Issues](https://github.com/MUJ-ACM-SCHAP/Android/issues) to make sure it has not been reported yet.
  * If not, [start a new issue](https://github.com/MUJ-ACM-SCHAP/Android/issues/new) and properly describe what problems you found and (if the issue is a bug in any code here), how to reproduce the issue.
  * Try to fix the issue yourself if you can by following the steps below!

* Want to fix an open issue? Wow! That's great! 
  * Firstly, go to [Issues](https://github.com/MUJ-ACM-SCHAP/Android/issues) and comment on the issue stating your intention to fix it. This assures that we dont have multiple people working on the same issue only to have duplicated their effort. 
  * Then, [Fork this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [clone your copy to your PC](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/).
  * Make all the changes you want to make in your local copy and [commit them](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github#make-changes-locally). Now, update local changes to your repo by [pushing the changes](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/). 
  * Now comes the easy part - go to github and open your repository. You will see the option to create a new pull request. Click on that and [make a new pull request](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github#create-pull-request) to our repository from yours. 
  * Assign [@yashovardhan99](https://github.com/orgs/MUJ-ACM-SCHAP/people/yashovardhan99) as the reviewer (only for the android repository) to ensure faster review and merging of your changes! That's it!

* Want to add to this repository like by adding your own project samples? That's awesome!!
  * First, fork this repo and clone it on your PC. 
   * Next, add the project files in a seperate directory in the `Examples` directory (like `Examples/Calculator` for a calculator app). 
   * Add a [`.gitignore`](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Android.gitignore) file and then commit all files (adding .gitignore before commiting ensures that files in the .gitignore are ignored by git).
   * Now, push your repository by using `git push orign [branch_name]`
   * Lastly, go to github and make a pull request to get those changes updated on our repo!
   
If you do end up making a pull request, be sure to keep an eye out for any reviews that may request you to make any changes before the PR is merged.

Thank you for contributing to this repository! You are doing a great thing and this helps you learn the basics of git which will be really really useful for you!
