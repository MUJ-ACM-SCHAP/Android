Feel free to expand the list with your own ideas or add description for something already here. To edit, simply press the edit button above (the one that looks like a pencil), make all changes and then propose those changes as a pull request.
## Super easy
* Score tracker - A simple app with 2 buttons to increment the scores of each team
* Counter - A button to just increment a counter by 1
* Password strength checker - define your own custom password strength criteria (like 8-15 characters, special characters etc. and then check if the password entered by the user matches the criteria)
## Easy
* Interest calculator - a simple app with possible options to calculate interest payment, final amount etc. with given data. Would need a few edit texts to input data, a button and some text views where the calculated data is stored.
* Age calculator - similar to interest calculator
* Dice roller (Random number generator)
* Guess the card (use random)
* Random password generator - hard coded criteria
## Medium
* Unit converter (pre set units and values)
* Currency converter (pre set units and values)
* Simple calculator (could expand on the design you already made. Does only 1 operation at a time and stores the answer in memory, so like I do 2+2 = 4 then when I press '+' and '2' it does 4+2 = 6)
* Quiz app (pre set questions and answers - show random MCQs from them and grade user)
* Hostel restaurants menu app (hard code items and prices)
* Tic Tac Toe (2 players)
* Random password generator - user enters password criteria
## Hard
* Stopwatch/Countdown timer
* Contact list (hard coded contacts with option to call)
* Tic Tac Toe (single player)
## Harder
* Bar code/QR code scanner
* Currency converter (fetch price from an online API)
