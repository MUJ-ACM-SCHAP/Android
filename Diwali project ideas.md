# Diwali Project Ideas 2018
Feel free to expand the list with your own ideas or add description for something already here. To edit, simply press the edit button above (the one that looks like a pencil), make all changes and then propose those changes as a pull request.
## Easy
* Interest calculator - a simple app with possible options to calculate interest payment, final amount etc. with given data. Would need a few edit texts to input data, a button and some text views where the calculated data is stored.
* Age calculator - similar to interest calculator
* Dice roller (Random number generator)
## Medium
* Unit converter (pre set units and values)
* Currency converter (pre set units and values)
* Simple calculator (could expand on the design you already made. Does only 1 operation at a time and stores the answer in memory, so like I do 2+2 = 4 then when I press '+' and '2' it does 4+2 = 6)
* Quiz app (pre set questions and answers - show random MCQs from them and grade user)
* Hostel restaurants menu app (hard code items and prices)
* Tic Tac Toe (2 players)
## Hard
* Stopwatch/Countdown timer
* Contact list (hard coded contacts with option to call)
* Tic Tac Toe (single player)
## Harder
* Bar code/QR code scanner
* Currency converter (fetch price from an online API)
