# Diwali Project Ideas 2018
* Interest calculator - a simple app with possible options to calculate interest payment, final amount etc. with given data. Would need a few edit texts to input data, a button and some text views where the calculated data is stored.
* Age calculator
* Tic Tac Toe (2 player)
* Stopwatch/Countdown timer
* Dice roller (Random number generator)
* Unit converter (pre set units and values)
* Currency converter (pre set units and values)
* Simple calculator (could expand on the design you already made. Does only 1 operation at a time)
* Quiz app (pre set questions and answers - show random MCQs from them and grade user)
* Hostel restaurants menu app (hard code items and prices)
* Contact list (hard coded contacts with option to call)

TODO: expand list AND categorize list into sections - easy, medium, hard)
